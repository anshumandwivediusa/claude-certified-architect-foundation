# 05. Claude Agent SDK — Building Agentic Systems

## 1. What is an Agentic Loop
- Core pattern for autonomous task execution.
- Model doesn’t just answer — it acts in a loop until completion.

### Execution Pattern
 - Request with tools → Send user input + tool definitions to Claude.
 - Model response → Assistant may output text or a tool_use block.
 - Stop reason check:
   - "tool_use" → execute tool, append tool_result to history, repeat.
   - "end_turn" → task complete, return final output.
 - Repeat until completion → Loop continues until reliable stop signal.

**This is a model-driven approach:** Claude decides which tool to call next based on context and prior tool results. This differs from hard-coded decision trees where the action sequence is fixed.

**Anti-patterns (avoid):**
- Parsing assistant text to detect completion (“Task completed”)
- Using an arbitrary iteration limit (e.g., `max_iterations=5`) as the primary stop condition
- Checking whether the assistant produced textual content as a completion signal

**Correct approach:** the only reliable completion signal is `stop_reason == "end_turn"`.

## 2 `AgentDefinition` Configuration

`AgentDefinition` is the agent configuration object in the Claude Agent SDK:

```python
agent = AgentDefinition(
    name="customer_support",
    description="Handles customer requests for returns and order issues",
    system_prompt="You are a customer support agent...",
    allowed_tools=["get_customer", "lookup_order", "process_refund", "escalate_to_human"],
    # For a coordinator:
    # allowed_tools=["Task", "get_customer", ...]
)
```

**Key parameters:**
- `name` / `description` — identification and description of the agent
- `system_prompt` — system prompt with instructions
- `allowed_tools` — list of allowed tools (principle of least privilege)


## Tool vs. Task

- **Tool**  
  - A **capability** exposed to the model (e.g., `search_web`, `compose_email`).  
  - Defined with a **name, schema, and parameters**.  
  - Passive — it does nothing until the model decides to call it.  
  - *Exam cue:* Think of a tool as a **function** or API endpoint.  

- **Task**  
  - A **unit of work** the agent must accomplish (e.g., “summarize article,” “book flight”).  
  - May require multiple tool calls + reasoning steps.  
  - Active — it represents the **goal** or job being executed.  
  - *Exam cue:* Task = **workflow objective**, not just a function.  



### Relationship
- Tools are **building blocks**.  
- Tasks are **orchestrated goals** that may use tools.  
- Example:  
  - Task: *“Find latest AI conference in India and draft an email invite.”*  
  - Tools: `search_web` (conference info), `compose_email` (draft invite).  



### Exam Trade‑offs
| **Aspect** | **Tool** | **Task** | **Exam Trap** |
|------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Definition** | Function/API | Goal/Objective | Confusing them as synonyms |
| **Scope** | Narrow capability | Broad execution | Forgetting tasks can span tools |
| **Control** | Schema‑driven | Context‑driven | Assuming tasks are predefined |
| **Lifecycle** | Called once | May loop until completion | Ignoring agentic loop |
| **Ownership** | Architect defines | Model orchestrates | Forgetting tasks are model‑driven |



### Anti‑Patterns
- Treating a **tool** as a **task** (e.g., “search_web = task”).  
- Designing tasks without clear **termination criteria**.  
- Overloading tools with task logic instead of keeping them atomic.  



### Key Principle
- **Tool = capability. Task = objective.**  
- Tools are invoked; tasks are completed.  
- Agentic loop = model orchestrates tools to achieve tasks.  



## 3 Hub-and-Spoke: Coordinator and Subagents

A multi-agent architecture is typically built as a hub-and-spoke topology:

```
         Coordinator
        /     |      \
   Subagent1  Subagent2  Subagent3
    (search)   (analysis)   (synthesis)
```

**The coordinator is responsible for:**
- Decomposing the task into subtasks
- Deciding which subagents are needed (dynamic selection)
- Delegating work to subagents
- Aggregating and validating results
- Handling errors and retries
- Communicating results to the user

**Critical principle: subagents have isolated context.**
- Subagents do **not** automatically inherit the coordinator's conversation history
- All required context must be **explicitly passed** in the subagent prompt
- Subagents do not share memory across calls
- All communication flows through the coordinator (for observability and error control)

## 4 The `Task` Tool for Spawning Subagents

Subagents are spawned via the `Task` tool:

```python
# The coordinator's allowedTools must include "Task"
coordinator_agent = AgentDefinition(
    allowed_tools=["Task", "get_customer"]
)
```

**Explicit context passing is mandatory:**

```
# Bad: the subagent has no context
Task: "Analyze the document"

# Good: full context in the prompt
Task: "Analyze the following document.
Document: [full document text]
Prior search results: [web search results]
Output format requirements: [schema]"
```

**Parallel spawning:** a coordinator can call multiple `Task`s in one response—subagents run in parallel:

```
# One coordinator response contains:
Task 1: "Search for articles about X"
Task 2: "Analyze document Y"
Task 3: "Search for articles about Z"
# All three run concurrently
```

## 5 Hooks in the Agent SDK

Hooks allow interception and transformation at specific points in the agent lifecycle.

**PostToolUse** intercepts a tool result before it is provided to the model:

```python
# Example: normalize date formats from different MCP tools
@hook("PostToolUse")
def normalize_dates(tool_result):
    # Convert Unix timestamp -> ISO 8601
    # Convert "Mar 5, 2025" -> "2025-03-05"
    return normalized_result
```

**Outgoing-call interception hook** blocks actions that violate policy:

```python
# Example: block refunds above $500
@hook("PreToolUse")
def enforce_refund_limit(tool_call):
    if tool_call.name == "process_refund" and tool_call.args.amount > 500:
        return redirect_to_escalation(tool_call)
```

**Key difference: hooks vs prompt instructions**

| Attribute | Hooks | Prompt instructions |
|---|---|---|
| Guarantee | **Deterministic** (100%) | **Probabilistic** (>90%, not 100%) |
| When to use | Critical business rules, financial operations, compliance | General preferences, recommendations, formatting |
| Example | Block refunds > $500 | “Try to solve before escalating” |

**Rule:** when failure has financial, legal, or safety consequences—use hooks, not prompts.
